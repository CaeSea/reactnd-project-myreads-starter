# Project 7: MyReads A Book Lending app

This project uses a backend API to store data on different genres of books. The app then allows the user to track books that they have read, want to read or are currently reading. It includes a search engine to navigate through the books and add them to the correct shelf. It is built using the React framework and uses features such as component, stateless functional components, props, state and React Router.

# How to install and run

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App
